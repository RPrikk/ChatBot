Java ChatBot

A JetBrains Academy Project

I have implemented the following features:

•Greet
  The bot greets the user and introduces itself
  Asks for the users name
•RemindName
  Takes string input of the users name and prints out a confirmation which contains what the user used as input
•GuessAge
  The bot guesses the users age by asking them to divide their age by 3, 5 and 7
  It runs a calculation based on the users input
•Count
  Asks the user for a number
  A loop starts that prints out all the numbers from 0 to the provided input
•Test
  A multiple choice question is provided to the user
  If the provided answer is wrong a message is printed and the user needs to choose another answer until they answer correctly and the while loop is exited
